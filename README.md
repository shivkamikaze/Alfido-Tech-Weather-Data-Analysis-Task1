# Alfido-Tech-Task 1:Weather-Data-Analysis
Weather Data Analysis project entails various data preprocessing techniques, data exploration and implementation of a Random Forest Classifier to predict weather descriptions based on provided weather dataset. The goal of this project is to build a reliable model for weather description classification, enabling applications in weather analysis.

Project Structure:- Weather Data Analysis that analyzes weather data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn.

Description:
Importing and preprocessing the weather data, including renaming columns, converting data types, and checking for null values and duplicates.
Exploratory data analysis, including generating summary statistics, creating visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and heatmaps, and calculating correlations between numerical columns.
Standardizing weather descriptions by replacing various descriptions with more consistent labels such as 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Rainy', 'Snowy', 'Haze', and 'Thunderstorms'.
Handling outliers by creating boxplots and removing outliers from specific columns using the interquartile range method.
Oversampling the data using SMOTE to balance the target variable.
Building a random forest classifier to predict the weather type based on other variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
Evaluating the model's accuracy using metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.

Conclusion:- Based on the evaluation of the Random Forest model, the project concludes that the model is effective in classifying weather descriptions. It achieves a high accuracy score of approximately 91%. The confusion matrix and classification report provide additional insights into the model's performance for different weather classes. This project serves as a comprehensive example of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning classification techniques in the context of weather data.
